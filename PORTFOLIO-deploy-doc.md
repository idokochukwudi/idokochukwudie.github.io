## DevOps Portfolio Deployment with GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

### Objective:

To create a live, professional DevOps portfolio at
https://idokochukwudi.github.io
‚Äî complete with automated deployment via GitHub Actions.

### Step 1: Fork the DevOps Portfolio Template

**Purpose:** I will start with a pre-built HTML/CSS portfolio designed for DevOps professionals.

- Visit: https://github.com/adityagundecha/DevOps-Portfolio

- Click the `‚ÄúFork‚Äù` button at the top right.

- Renamed my `forked repository` to:
`idokochukwudie.github.io`

    ![](./img-documentation/2.rename-repo.png)


**Why this name?**

GitHub will automatically serve my site at:
https://idokochukwudie.github.io

### Step 2: Clone and Customize Locally

**Purpose:** Personalize my `portfolio` ‚Äî add **my name, bio, and tools.**

**Clone the Repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idokochukwudie/idokochukwudie.github.io.git
cd idokochukwudie.github.io
```

```bash
code .   # (This opens VS Code. Use your preferred editor)
```

![](./img-documentation/6.repo-open-in-vs-code.png)

### I will Edit These Files:

- **index.html** ‚Äî update name, intro, and links

- **assets/img/** ‚Äî replace with my profile picture or diagrams


### Stage 3: Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow for CI/CD

**Purpose:**

To automate the deployment of my static **DevOps portfolio** to **GitHub Pages** every time I push changes to my repository.

**üîß Update: Existing Workflow Found**

When I **cloned** the template, there was already a** GitHub Actions workflow** named `main.yml` under:

```
.github/workflows/main.yml
```

This workflow was originally configured to deploy the site to **Netlify**, not **GitHub Pages**.

**What I Did:**

1. Renamed the workflow file from `main.yml` to `deploy.yml` for clarity and alignment with GitHub Pages:

    ![](./img-documentation/7.rename-yml-file.png)

2. Replaced the `Netlify` webhook script with a `GitHub Pages deployment workflow` using the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` action ‚Äî ideal for plain `HTML/CSS/JS` portfolios.

### Step 4: Push Changes to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial customization and CI/CD setup"
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to my GitHub repo: `idokochukwudie.github.io`
2. Click **Settings > Pages**
3. Under **Source**, choose:
      - GitHub Actions
      - Deploy from Branch: gh-pages
      - Folder: / (`root`)
4. Click `Save`

### Initial Access Error

When I initially visited the page at https://idokochukwudie.github.io/, an error message was displayed:

```
404  
There isn't a GitHub Pages site here.
```

This indicated that the GitHub Pages site had not yet been properly set up or deployed.

### Renaming Repository and Updating Local Remote URL

**Purpose:**

To ensure that my portfolio site is deployed correctly at `https://idokochukwudi.github.io`, the repository must be named **exactly** like the **GitHub username** followed by `.github.io`.

**Steps Taken:**

1. Renamed GitHub Repository

   - Initially, the repository was named: `idokochukwudie.github.io`
   - I renamed it via GitHub to match my correct username: `idokochukwudi.github.io`

This naming ensures GitHub Pages can deploy the site at:

‚û°Ô∏è `https://idokochukwudi.github.io`

**2. Updated Local Git Remote URL**

After renaming the repo on GitHub, I needed to update my local repository to reflect this change.

### Step-by-step:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd idokochukwudie.github.io

# Check the current remote URL
git remote -v

# Update the remote URL to the new repo name
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/idokochwudi/idokochukwudi.github.io.git

# Verify that the URL was updated
git remote -v
```

### Result:

My local Git repository now correctly points to the renamed remote repo, and I can push code without any issues. GitHub Pages also successfully renders the site at:

üìç`https://idokochukwudi.github.io/`
